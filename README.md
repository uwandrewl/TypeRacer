# Type Racing Game
Author: Andrew Lu

- An app that allows you to play up to 20 concurrent games!
- Supports undo/redo actions on font resizing, word completion/selection and resetting the game
- Built using MVC/Observer pattern for the multiple views on the same internal state
- Memento pattern captures the internal state in chunks allowing for undo/redo actions
- Utilized CSS styling and wrote the game imperatively as Typescript/CSS modules
- Transpiled all the Typescript and CSS files (why you only see one .ts and .css file!)
